          <h4>Geography</h4>
          <p class="greenland">With a total land area of 66 km2, Tagaytay represents 4.37% of Cavite provinceâ€™s total land area. The city overlooks Manila Bay to its north, Laguna de Bay to its east, and Taal Volcano and Taal Lake to its south.

            Tagaytay City is both upland hilly and upland mountainous, particularly on its easter and southern sections. Forests, open grasslands, and pine trees cover the said areas.
            
            The city also lies along Tagaytay Ridge at the edge of Taal Caldera that stretches to up to 32 kilometers from Mount Batulaoand Mount Sungay in the west and east, respectively. The latter is the highest point in Cavite, at 709 meters or 2,326 feet above sea level.
            
            Tagaytay Ridge also overlooks Taal Lake. The urban center is located atop the caldera rim. Deep ravines drop steeply to the lake and are found beyond the edge.
            
            The sloping surface covers areas of Mendez, Amadeo, Silang, Indang, and Alfonso.
            
            Such a unique geographic feature makes the development of a mountainous resort, for instance, possible. Case in point: Tagaytay Highlands, which is situated on the highest point of the city.
            
            Tagaytay Highlands is a network of exclusive themed residential communities, including The Highlands, The Midlands, and The Greenlands.</p>
